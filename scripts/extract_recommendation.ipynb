    "You are given a resume and a recommendation letter. Your task is to evaluate the recommendation in relation to the resume and provide a JSON output based on the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Relevance Score (1-10)**:\n",
    "   - 1-3 (Low): The recommendation is barely relevant to the resume, with little or no connection between the skills, experience, or roles mentioned.\n",
    "   - 4-6 (Moderate): The recommendation mentions some skills or experiences from the resume but lacks substantial detail or alignment with the key areas of expertise.\n",
    "   - 7-9 (High): The recommendation covers many of the key skills, roles, or accomplishments from the resume, with strong alignment and relevant details.\n",
    "   - 10 (Exceptional): The recommendation is highly relevant, fully aligning with all key skills, experiences, and roles from the resume, providing strong support for the candidate's qualifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fraud Chance Level (1-5)**:\n",
    "   - 1 (Low): The recommendation seems genuine and well-supported by the resume. No informal language, statistically improbable data, or red flags.\n",
    "   - 2 (Moderate): Some minor inconsistencies or exaggerated claims are present, but the recommendation remains largely credible.\n",
    "   - 3 (Concerning): Multiple claims seem exaggerated or unsupported, with a lack of concrete examples or evidence from the resume.\n",
    "   - 4 (High): Several aspects of the recommendation are unrealistic, with improper language or statistically improbable claims.\n",
    "   - 5 (Very High): The majority of the recommendation seems fraudulent, with obvious signs of exaggeration, improper language, or contradictory data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recommendation Verification of Skills**:\n",
    "   - Identify which specific skills mentioned in the resume are validated or referenced by the recommendation.\n",
    "   - List these skills in an array.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Source of Recommendation**:\n",
    "   - Identify the relationship of the person giving the recommendation:\n",
    "     - **Boss/Supervisor**: Directly overseeing or managing the candidate.\n",
    "     - **Peer**: Colleague or coworker at the same level.\n",
    "     - **Unknown**: The source of the recommendation is unclear or not specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Additional Criteria for Fraud Detection**:\n",
    "   - **Informal Language**: Check for the use of casual or informal language inappropriate for a formal recommendation. If found, increase the fraud chance level by 1.\n",
    "   - **Statistically Improbable Claims**: Analyze whether the claims made in the recommendation seem unrealistic given the candidate’s domain, experience level, or position. If such claims are present, set the fraud chance level to 5 and provide reasoning.\n",
