Led a team of five network and equipment support specialists. Configured, maintained, analyzed, and troubleshot Nortel and Juniper networks, systems, and equipment (WAN/LAN/WLAN infrastructure, servers, PCs, notebooks, thin clients, printers, and other peripherals) used by 600 workers in Georgia. Supported 200 units configured for operation through client servers. Advanced global company objectives through participation in IT and telecom design and implementation. Advanced to this role through promotions from Mechanical Drafter, Engineering Checker, Mechanical Designer, and Network Administrator. Slashed support requests 75%, cut equipment costs 50%, and boosted work productivity 30% by applying near-zero configuration to develop, install, and implement a thin client solution for 90 plant manufacturing cells. Reduced standard company imaging and system deployment time 60% before station-specific customization by replacing and/or refreshing 40 PCs each quarter, 100% on schedule. Planned, designed, installed, configured, and tested wireless networks (WLAN from Cisco, Nortel, and Meraki) in multiple facilities; documented standards for US operations; trained users; and monitored performance. Replaced 125 field and service laptops by programming standard images and custom configurations on each machine, completing the six-week project on schedule despite disruption of parts availability due to a tsunami. Championed the use of computers in manufacturing cells to provide drawings and also facilitate order tracking in conjunction with the ERP system; designed and implemented automated pick list and shipping documents as well as real-time tracking for distribution. Trained and mentored 15 new department staff members and contractors.",
