        "fraud_reason": "The recommendation contains statistically improbable claims and exaggerated language, with no clear connection to the candidate's skills and experience in the banking and customer service industries. The mention of 'circus management' and 'orchestrating extraordinary events' seems unrelated to the candidate's job history and skills.",

        "notes": "The recommendation lacks specific examples and details about the candidate's skills and experience, and the language used is overly exaggerated and unrelated to the candidate's job history. While the recommendation mentions customer service and problem-solving skills, it does not provide concrete evidence or examples to support these claims."
