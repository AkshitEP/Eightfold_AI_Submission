The recommendation highlights the individual's expertise in employee relations, compliance, and strategic HR alignment, which is not present in the resume. However, the recommendation does mention the individual's experience as a Communicable Disease Specialist, showcasing their abilities in data analysis, disease intervention, and public health education."
