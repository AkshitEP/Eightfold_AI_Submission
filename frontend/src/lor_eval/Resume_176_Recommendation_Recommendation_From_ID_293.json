        "fraud_reason": "The recommendation seems unrealistic and exaggerated, with the recommender drawing an unlikely parallel between their experience as a dance instructor and the candidate's role as a Benefit Advocate Supervisor. The language used is overly flattering and lacks concrete examples or evidence from the resume.",

        "notes": "The recommendation lacks specific examples and details from the candidate's work experience, and the comparison to the recommender's experience as a dance instructor seems forced and unconvincing. While the recommendation mentions some relevant skills, it does not provide a clear or credible assessment of the candidate's abilities."
