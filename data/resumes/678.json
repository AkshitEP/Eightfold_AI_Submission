Implemented low-speed wind and water tunnel testing using test models to obtain and investigate flight dynamics and performance characteristics. Analyzed the flow vortices over the wing at varying velocities at increasing angles of attacks. Calculated and observed the relationship and importance of the effect of Reynold's numbers on aerodynamic coefficients. Compiled a technical report detailing the results of the calculations and observations, and compared the accuracy of wind/water tunnel testing to theoretical F-22 characteristics.",

Worked directly with the UAVs to take accurate measurements in order to model it. Designed accurate aerodynamic models of the UAVs using the program AVL, a program for the aerodynamic and flight-dynamic analysis of rigid aircraft of arbitrary configuration. Modeled all lifting surfaces, control surfaces, and fuselage. Created data and run files of mass properties corresponding with each UAV. Executed the run files for each UAV in order to obtain a full linearization of the aerodynamic model about any flight state with specified mass properties. Extracted stability-axis derivatives that will be imported into the flight simulation program, FlightGear, to model the simulated plane to have the same flight characteristics and behaviors as the UAVS.",
