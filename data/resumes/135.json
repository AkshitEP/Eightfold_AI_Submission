                "work_description": "Recruited by the Board of Directors to become COO. Oversaw all aspects of this 35+ year old medical practice comprised of 5 freestanding radiation oncology clinics located in the South Puget Sound with 8 physicians (6 whom are owners) and 64 employees. Revenues grew from $48MM in 2008 to over $53MM in 2014. This was due to the addition of two offices (one in Gig Harbor and one in Olympia) as well as additional modalities of treatment. Achievements: Saved the company over $160,000 in 2015 due to hard negotiations with our Electronic Medical Record vendor due to poor performance. Saved the company over $120,000 annually by negotiating with the bank to lower interest rates on loans in early 2009. Brought two construction projects, one for a new clinic with a $6.5MM budget and the other for an extensive remodel with a $4.5MM budget, under budget and on time saving $200,000 in total. Brought in a consultant to successfully turn the Board Meetings into efficient, professional meetings with strict agendas, time allotments for each topic and rules of order. Oversaw the opening of and addition of a Urology practice as well as the first mobile Brachytherapy unit in the State of WA (for the treatment of various types of cancer). Both contributed to an increase in revenues to the company of more than $1MM annually. Successfully negotiated with two of the owners for buyouts on behalf of the Board. One was amicable and the other was contentious. This will result in cost savings to the company in excess of $1MM annually.",
