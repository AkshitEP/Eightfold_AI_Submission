Researched and found causes of variances from 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011. Worked with Financial Adjustments/ Funding to facilitate the review and clearance of issues. Reduced specific large Vendor credits owed from over ($35,700.00) to $0. Reduced Payables on HOLD from over $96,000.00 to $0.00. Decreased the contract variances caused by incorrect dispositions over 365 days with balances from Over ($163,000.00) down to less than ($25,000.00) in balances from 2006-2011. Reduced overall outstanding aging variances aged under 60 days in the Bank Holding Company GL from over ($302,000.00) to less than ($900.00) and in the Bank GL from over ($111,000.00) to under $ 25.00 aged under 60 days (to be clawed back). Cleaned up and streamlined the Fixed Maintenance recs and procedures. Exposed a flaw in the Funding process where Voided checks and failed ACH's were not routinely monitored and re-issued, and the process of monitoring Payments on HOLD to Dealers that owed CIT money, resulting in the new API process for setting up payables in a separate account from all GL accounts to track all payables, liabilities and receivables.",
