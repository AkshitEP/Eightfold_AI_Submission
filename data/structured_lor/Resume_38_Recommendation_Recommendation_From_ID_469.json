        "fraud_reason": "The recommendation seems to be written by someone who is familiar with the candidate's background, but there are some inconsistencies and exaggerated claims. The recommendation mentions the candidate's experience as a Physical Therapy Aide, which is not present in the resume. Additionally, the recommendation highlights the candidate's technical acumen as an Aviation Electronics Technician, but the language used is somewhat generic and lacks specific examples.",
