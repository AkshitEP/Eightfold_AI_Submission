        "notes": "The recommendation highlights the IT manager's skills in project management, troubleshooting, and vendor contract negotiation, which aligns with their resume. However, the recommendation also mentions a staff accountant, which seems unrelated to the IT manager's role. The recommendation is generally formal and lacks informal language, but the mention of the staff accountant might indicate a slight deviation from the IT manager's actual role."
