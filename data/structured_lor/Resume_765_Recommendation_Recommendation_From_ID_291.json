The recommender mentions the candidate's role as a fitness instructor, but the resume does not mention this role.

However, the recommender also mentions the candidate's role as a fitness instructor, which is not present in the resume. The recommendation also mentions the candidate's entrepreneurial spirit, which is not directly mentioned in the resume but can be inferred from their experience in sales and customer service roles."
